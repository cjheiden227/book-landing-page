				<h2>About the Book</h2>
				
				<p>Dr. Thomas Curtis has been practicing medical-legal psychiatry in the Los Angeles area since 1973. After a decade of private practice and court consultation in child custody cases, Dr. Curtis became an employee’s doctor in the Workers’ Compensation field.</p>

				<p>Could you imagine the uproar from his patients if he exposed them in this book? Instead, examples are drawn from famous cases and political contests.</p>

				<h3>Defend Against the Defense</h3>
				<p>How much of the overwhelming DNA evidence against O. J. Simpson was considered by the jury? Answer: none. Why? Because the defense discredited the LAPD. You must defend against the defense.</p>

				<h3>Overstatement Kills</h3>
				<p>“l’m John Kerry, and l’m reporting for duty.” Did this over-reach lead to Kerry being swiftboated out of a possible presidency?</p>

				<h3>Winner of the Worst Witness in the World Award - Brett Kavanaugh</h3>
				<p>Brett scored 10 out of 10 in all 10 areas--defensiveness, insultingness, evasiveness, turning the question around, self-pitying exaggeration, protesting the procedures, repeating absurdities, attempting false sympathy, and creating a false alibi.</p>

				<h3>Preparation, Preparation, Preparation</h3>
				<p>Did Ronald Reagan retain his presidency by a perfectly practiced one-liner? "I will not make an issue of age in this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience." Similarly, did Michael Dukakis blow his debate for the presidency by uttering a singular one-line blunder?</p>

			<h2>From the Author</h2>
			<p>Litigation manuals and guidelines may be abundantly available for lawyers, doctors, accountants and other specialists. However, such sources are scarcely reviewed with the person with the case. </p>

			<p>Your case may be a big case or a small case, a good case or a bad case, a no-stress case or a catastrophic case, you may have this type of case or that type of case. You can be on this side or the other side. None of this matters. The concepts of success apply to all cases. </p>

			<p>If you have a case, you should invest in it by reading, <strong>How to Win Your Case.</strong> </p>

			<p>As well, I wrote this book to be entertaining for all readers. </p>

			<p><strong>How to Win Your Case.</strong> is available on Amazon. </p>
			<p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
