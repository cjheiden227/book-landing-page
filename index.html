				<h2>About the Book</h2>
				<p>Dr. Thomas Curtis has been a medical-legal psychiatrist in the Los Angeles area since 1973. After a decade of private practice and court consultation in child custody cases, Dr. Curtis became an employee’s doctor in the Workers’ Compensation field.</p>

				<p>Could you imagine the uproar from his patients if he exposed them in this book? Instead, examples are drawn from famous cases and political contests.</p>

				<h2>Defend Against the Defense</h2>
				<p>How much of the overwhelming DNA evidence against O. J. Simpson was considered by the jury? Answer: none. Why? Because the defense discredited the LAPD. You must defend against the defense.</p>

				<h2>Overstatement Kills</h2>
				<p>“l’m John Kerry, and l’m reporting for duty.” Did this over-reach lead to Kerry being swiftboated out of a possible presidency?</p>

				<h2>Winner of the Worst Witness in the World Award - Brett Kavanaugh</h2>
				<p>Brett scored 10 out of 10 in all 10 areas--defensiveness, insultingness, evasiveness, turning the question around, self-pitying exaggeration, protesting the procedures, repeating absurdities, attempting false sympathy, and creating a false alibi.</p>

				<h2>Preparation, Preparation, Preparation</h2>
				<p>Did Ronald Reagan retain his presidency by a perfectly practiced one-liner? "I will not make an issue of age in this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience." Similarly, did Michael Dukakis blow his debate for the presidency by uttering a singular one-line blunder?</p>

				<p>These are four of about 60 sections—attorneys, judges, testimony, settlements, injustice—all interspersed with lighter sections such as liars club, categorical de-niers, cover-up downfalls, litigation likables, questionably credible famous witnesses, and so on.</p>

				<h2>From the Author</h2>
				<p>I wrote this book to be entertaining to all readers. However, my primary purpose was to educate the layperson how to navigate litigation.</p>

				<p>Litigation manuals and guidelines may be abundantly available for lawyers, doctors, accountants and other specialists. However, such sources are scarcely available for the person actively participating in the litigation.</p>

				<p>No matter what type of case you have or which side you're on, the concepts of success in litigation apply to all cases. </p>

				<p>If you are involved in litigation, you should invest in it by buying this book.</p>
